# Requirements and Installation

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version >= 1.4.0
* Python version >= 3.6
* For training new models, you'll also need an NVIDIA GPU and [NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)
* **To install fairseq** and develop locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./

# on MacOS:
# CFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++" pip install --editable ./
```
* **For faster training** install NVIDIA's [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
pip install -v --no-cache-dir --global-option="--cpp_ext" --global-option="--cuda_ext" \
  --global-option="--deprecated_fused_adam" --global-option="--xentropy" \
  --global-option="--fast_multihead_attn" ./
```
* **For large datasets** install [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/install.html#using-pip): `pip install pyarrow`
* If you use Docker make sure to increase the shared memory size either with
`--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` as command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.


# Getting Started

The [full documentation](https://fairseq.readthedocs.io/) contains instructions
for getting started, training new models and extending fairseq with new model
types and tasks.

# Pre-trained models and examples

We provide pre-trained models and pre-processed, binarized test sets for several tasks listed below,
as well as example training and evaluation commands.

- [Translation](examples/translation/README.md): convolutional and transformer models are available
- [Language Modeling](examples/language_model/README.md): convolutional and transformer models are available
